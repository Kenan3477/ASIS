## üåê RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

### Option 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project" 
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your `ASIS` repository (Kenan3477/ASIS)
6. Select the `main` branch
7. Railway will automatically detect the `railway.json` configuration
8. Click "Deploy" - Your 100% verified ASIS will be live!

### Option 2: Railway CLI (if available)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### Option 3: Direct File Upload
1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app) 
2. Create a new project
3. Upload these key files:
   - `asis_100_percent_production.py` (main application)
   - `requirements.txt` (dependencies)
   - `railway.json` (configuration)
   - All database files (asis_*.db)

## üìã DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION

The system is configured to run:
- **Start Command**: `python asis_100_percent_production.py`
