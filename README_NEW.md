from asis_main import ASIS

async def main():
    # Create and initialize ASIS
    asis = ASIS("MyASIS")
    await asis.initialize()
    
    # Process an experience
    await asis.process_experience(
        "I'm learning about quantum computing", 
        "education", 
        importance=0.8
    )
    
    # Ask ASIS to think
    thought = await asis.think("What is consciousness?")
    print(f"ASIS thinks: {thought}")
    
    # Set a goal
    await asis.set_goal("Understand the nature of reality", priority=0.9)
    
    # Conduct research
    research = await asis.conduct_research("quantum consciousness theories")
    
    # Enable autonomous operation
    await asis.autonomous_mode_toggle(True)

# Run the example
asyncio.run(main())
```
