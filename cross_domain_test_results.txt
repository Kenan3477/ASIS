🎉 Cross-domain reasoning test PASSED!
💡 The original quick_cross_domain_test.py issue was likely
💡 related to terminal output capture, not the engine itself

📋 NEXT STEPS:
1. Cross-domain engine is confirmed working
2. You can use it in your AGI integration
3. The confidence score shows good performance
