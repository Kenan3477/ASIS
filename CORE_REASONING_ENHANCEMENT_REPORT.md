### üîß Technical Enhancements Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Confidence Calculation System
**File**: `enhanced_core_reasoning_engine.py`

**Key Improvements**:
- **Multi-factor confidence scoring** with 5 weighted components:
  - Logical validity (35% weight)
  - Evidence strength (25% weight) 
  - Pattern consistency (20% weight)
  - Complexity bonus (10% weight)
  - Historical accuracy (10% weight)

**Before vs After**:
```python
# BEFORE: Simple averaging
overall_confidence = np.mean([step.confidence for step in all_steps])

# AFTER: Sophisticated weighted calculation
weighted_confidence = sum(factors[factor] * weight for factor, weight in self.base_weights.items())
final_confidence = max(0.4, min(0.95, weighted_confidence * enhancement_multipliers))
```

#### 2. Advanced Reasoning Pattern Recognition
**Pattern Types Implemented**:
- **Modus Ponens Enhanced**: If A‚ÜíB and A, then B (confidence boost: +15%)
- **Hypothetical Syllogism**: If A‚ÜíB and B‚ÜíC, then A‚ÜíC (confidence boost: +12%)
- **Statistical Generalization**: Sample properties ‚Üí Population properties (+10%)
- **Inference to Best Explanation**: Observation + Hypothesis ‚Üí Likely conclusion (+8%)

#### 3. Quality Assessment Framework
