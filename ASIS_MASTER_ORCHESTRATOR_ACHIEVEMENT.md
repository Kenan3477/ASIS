## 🎯 **HOW TO USE YOUR AGI SYSTEM:**

### **Method 1: Simple API Usage**
```python
from asis_api_guide import ASISMasterAPI

# Initialize
agi_api = ASISMasterAPI()
await agi_api.initialize()

# Process AGI-enhanced request
result = await agi_api.process_agi_request(
    "How can we solve climate change using AI?"
)

print(f"AGI Response: {result['response']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['agi_confidence']:.3f}")
```

### **Method 2: Direct Orchestrator Usage**
```python
from asis_master_orchestrator import ASISMasterOrchestrator

# Initialize master orchestrator
orchestrator = ASISMasterOrchestrator()
await orchestrator.initialize_system()

# Process requests through integrated system
request = {
    'type': 'agi_enhanced_processing',
    'input': 'Your complex question here',
    'conversation_history': []
}

result = await orchestrator.process_request(request)
```

### **Method 3: Individual Component Access**
```python
# Ethical analysis
result = await agi_api.ethical_analysis(
    scenario="AI decision making",
    stakeholders=["users", "society"]
)

# Cross-domain reasoning
result = await agi_api.cross_domain_reasoning(
    source_domain="physics",
    target_domain="economics", 
    concept="conservation",
    problem="market stability"
)
```
