# Interest Formation System Integration Module

This module integrates the Interest Formation System with the main ASIS memory network, providing seamless curiosity-driven learning and attention management.

## Integration Points

1. **Memory Network Integration**
   - Connects with existing memory storage and retrieval
   - Feeds interesting discoveries into long-term memory
   - Uses memory patterns to identify novel information

2. **Learning System Integration**
   - Works with adaptive learning mechanisms
   - Provides curiosity-driven exploration targets
   - Reinforces learning based on interest outcomes

3. **Attention Management Integration**
   - Coordinates with cognitive processing priorities
   - Balances exploration vs exploitation
   - Manages cognitive resources effectively

## Usage Example

```python
from memory_network import MemoryNetwork
from interest_formation_system import InterestFormationSystem

# Initialize both systems
memory_network = MemoryNetwork()
interest_system = InterestFormationSystem()

# Process information through both systems
async def integrated_processing(information, context=None):
    # First, check if information is novel and interesting
    new_interest = await interest_system.process_new_information(information, context)
    
    # Store in memory network if significant
    if new_interest or context.get('force_store', False):
        memory_network.store_information(information, context)
    
    # Allocate attention based on current interests
    attention_allocations = interest_system.allocate_attention_to_interests(context)
    
    # Return integrated results
    return {
        'new_interest': new_interest,
        'attention_allocations': attention_allocations,
        'memory_stored': new_interest is not None
    }
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Curiosity-Driven Exploration
- **NoveltyDetector**: Identifies novel information across multiple dimensions
- **CuriosityEngine**: Manages exploration energy and triggers
- **ExplorationEvent**: Tracks exploration outcomes and learning

### 2. Interest Formation and Evolution
- **Interest**: Comprehensive interest representation with temporal tracking
- **InterestType**: Classification of different interest types
- **Evolution tracking**: Monitors how interests change over time

### 3. Attention Allocation
- **AttentionManager**: Sophisticated attention distribution system
- **AttentionAllocation**: Detailed attention assignment with context awareness
- **Priority-based distribution**: Uses power law for realistic attention patterns

### 4. Pattern Recognition
- **Exploration patterns**: Identifies what triggers curiosity most effectively
- **Preference evolution**: Tracks how preferences change over time
- **Success correlation**: Links exploration outcomes to interest reinforcement

### 5. Relationship Mapping
- **Interest relationships**: Tracks connections between related interests
- **Hierarchical structures**: Parent-child interest relationships
- **Network effects**: Interests can reinforce each other

## Advanced Capabilities

### Autonomous Discovery
