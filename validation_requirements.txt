# ASIS AGI Validation System Requirements
# =====================================

# Core Python Libraries (usually included with Python)
asyncio>=3.4.0
json
sqlite3
datetime
time
logging
pathlib
typing
argparse

# External Dependencies (install with pip)
psutil>=5.8.0          # For system monitoring and memory checks

# Optional Dependencies for Enhanced Features
numpy>=1.21.0          # For numerical computations in validation
matplotlib>=3.5.0      # For generating validation charts and graphs  
pandas>=1.3.0          # For data analysis and reporting
plotly>=5.0.0          # For interactive validation dashboards

# Development and Testing
pytest>=6.0.0          # For unit testing the validation framework
pytest-asyncio>=0.18.0 # For async test support
coverage>=6.0.0        # For test coverage reporting

# Optional: Enhanced Analysis
scikit-learn>=1.0.0    # For advanced statistical analysis of results
scipy>=1.7.0           # For scientific computing in validation metrics

# Installation Instructions:
# ========================
# 
# 1. Basic Installation (required):
#    pip install psutil
#
# 2. Full Installation (recommended):
#    pip install psutil numpy matplotlib pandas plotly pytest pytest-asyncio coverage scikit-learn scipy
#
# 3. Quick Installation Script:
#    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
#    pip install -r validation_requirements.txt
#
# Note: The validation system will work with just the basic installation,
#       but enhanced features require the full installation.
