```env
# Gmail SMTP (recommended for academic outreach)
GMAIL_EMAIL=your-business@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password

# SendGrid Alternative
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-sendgrid-api-key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=contact@yourcompany.com

# Business Contact Information
COMPANY_NAME=ASIS Research Intelligence
BUSINESS_EMAIL=support@asisresearch.com
BUSINESS_PHONE=+1-555-YOUR-NUMBER

```bash
curl https://web-production-e42ae.up.railway.app/health
```

### 3. Academic Contacts Verification
Expand the verified contacts database:
- Add more universities to target list
- Verify faculty email addresses are current
- Update research area mappings

### 4. Trial Account Configuration  
Set up JWT secret keys and database:
```env
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
TRIAL_DATABASE_PATH=./trial_users.db
```

## üéØ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

#### Option B: SendGrid Setup
1. Create SendGrid account (free tier: 100 emails/day)
2. Generate API key with Mail Send permissions
3. Verify sender identity

### Step 3: Test Individual Systems
```bash
# Test email system
python -c "from real_email_system import RealEmailSystem; RealEmailSystem().test_connection()"

# Test platform integration
python -c "from real_value_proposition import RealPlatformIntegration; import asyncio; asyncio.run(RealPlatformIntegration().test_platform_availability())"

# Test trial system
python real_trial_system.py
```

### Step 4: Execute Production Campaign
```bash
python real_customer_acquisition_system.py
```
