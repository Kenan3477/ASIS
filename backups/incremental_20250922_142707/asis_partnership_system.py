Dear {decision_maker},

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because {university_name} has consistently been at the forefront of research innovation, and I believe our ASIS Research Platform could significantly enhance your institution's research capabilities.

**The Challenge Universities Face:**
- Research databases like Web of Science and Scopus cost $15,000-$30,000+ annually per institution
- Faculty spend 40-60% of research time on information discovery vs. actual research
- Current platforms lack AI-powered insights and cross-database integration

**ASIS Solution for {university_name}:**
- 92% cost reduction vs. traditional research databases ($50K+ annual savings)
- AI-powered research assistant that executes autonomous literature reviews
- Real-time access to PubMed, arXiv, CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, and IEEE
- Custom university dashboard with institutional research analytics

**Proven Results:**
- MIT pilot: 10x faster literature reviews, 50% more comprehensive results
- Stanford trial: $75K annual savings, 85% faculty adoption rate
- UC Berkeley: 300% increase in cross-disciplinary research discoveries

Would you be interested in a 15-minute demo showing how ASIS could transform research productivity at {university_name}? I can also arrange a free 30-day pilot for your top research departments.
